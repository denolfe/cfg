echo RCON COMMANDS ---------
echo -----------------------
echo rcon say "HEY YO I HAVE TEH RCONZ"
echo rcon changelevel <mapname> // will force a level change.
echo rcon maps * // will show you all maps installed on the server
echo rcon sv_alltalk 0/1 // setting this to 1 will allow everyone to talk to each other using both text and voice including spectators
echo rcon mp_timelimit X // sets the timelimit of the current map to X. If a round ends with <=5 minutes to go the map ends. (unless maxrounds or winlimit is reached first)
echo rcon mp_winlimit X // a team must win X rounds to end the map. (unless timelimit or maxrounds is reached first)
echo rcon mp_maxrounds X // map ends when X rounds have been reached (unless winlimit or timelimit is reached first)
echo rcon mp_scrambleteams // will randomise the teams. Useful for pugs when no captains step up. May not randomise very well. Run it a few times if the teams remain unbalanced.
echo rcon mp_restartgame X // restarts game in X seconds.
echo rcon mp_tournament 1 // turns tournament mode on. There are a few changes to the server to make it easier for tournament play. This will be explained for ozfc2, where tournament mode will be required. Stops the map from changing at the end of a match, and allows clans to muck around and reset the server themselves without rcon using the tournament interface.
echo rcon tf_weapon_criticals 0 // turns crits off (defaults to 1 to turn them back on)
echo rcon mp_friendlyfire 1 // turns friendlyfire on; 0 for off (defaults to off)
echo rcon mp_disable_respawn_times 0 // turns respawn times off, 1 for on (defaults to on)
echo -----------------------
echo rcon users // shows list of users including userid
echo rcon kick "X" // kicks by player name. Bit hard to do if the player has a wankername
echo rcon kickid userid/uniqueid "message" // kicks player; userid = first 2/3 digits in 'rcon users', uniqueid = steam id
echo rcon banid minutes userid/uniqueid [kick] // bans the player for minutes. see kickid for id details. kick is an optional param, if used it will also kick the player. Use 0 minutes for permanent
echo rcon unbanid X // unbans the id
echo rcon addip minutes X // bans IP address for minutes specified. Use 0 minutes for permanent
echo rcon removeip X // removes IP ban
